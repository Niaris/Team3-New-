Import the projects into eclipse workspace. Then Import Team3 (You can now delete 1 - OPEN ME FIRST if you want)
 and Right Click on Team3 and select properties, and Import the two projects. 
If there are errors with google-play-services_lib, then either you do not have Google Play Services installed or you have to update it.
If you need to update, update it and import it to the workspace by going to Eclipse and going to: 
1. File
2. Import
3. Android
4. Existing Android Project 
5. Locate where you saved your Android SDK and then 
6. extras
7. google
8. google_play_services
9. libproject
10.google-play-services_lib
11. Run the project into a mobile device (preferably) or an emulator.
Thats it :)
